          Starfield Players Are Really Trying to Pretend It's On PlayStation
        </h3>
        <h5>Game:<a href="../game2.html">STARFIELD</a></h5>
        <p>
          Starfield is now available on PC and as an Xbox Series X and S console
          exclusive, but some players are really trying to pretend it's on
          PlayStation 5 too.

        <p>
          From using the DualSense controller to play the game, to creating
          custom "limited edition" Starfield PS5s, and even modding in the
          PlayStation Studios intro, some users have seemingly taken Bethesda's
          Xbox exclusivity hard.
