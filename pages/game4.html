      <p>
        The online video game and game creation system Roblox has numerous games
        (officially referred to as "experiences")[1][2] created by users of
        their creation tool, Roblox Studio. Due to Roblox's popularity, various
        games created on the site have grown increasing attention in popularity,
        with some games having millions of active players monthly, about 5,000
        games having over a million visits, and a few having over a billion.[3]
        Some games have received media coverage as a result.

        Adopt Me! is a massively multiplayer online game where the nominal focus
        is players pretending to be either parents adopting a child, or children
        getting adopted, though the de facto focus is around adopting and caring
        for many different pets, who can be traded with other players.[4] As of
        October 2022, the game had been played upwards of thirty billion
        times.[5] Adopt Me! was averaging 600,000 concurrent players as of June
        2020, making it the most popular game on Roblox.[4] Due to the high cost
        of pets within the game, with some rare pets selling for up to US$100, a
        large number of scammers have risen up within the game. As the primary
        user base of Adopt Me! is on average younger than the rest of Roblox,
        they are especially susceptible to falling for scams.[6][7] Uplift
        Games, the studio behind the game, has accumulated over $16 million in
        revenue, mostly from microtransactions.[8][9] The game won three awards
        in the 2020 Bloxy Awards.[10]
