        <p>Starfield is an action role-playing video game. The player can switch between a first-person and third-person perspective any time. Starfield features an open world in the form of an area within the Milky Way galaxy, containing both fictional and non-fictional planetary systems. The player is able to land on more than 1,000 planets and an unspecified number of moons and space stations. The majority of the landscapes within the game were procedurally generated; they were subsequently modified and handcrafted content was developed around them. The game generates the terrain and the alien flora and fauna of a planet depending on the star of its system and its atmosphere, as well as locations of interest as the player approaches a planet.[6] The largest city in the game, New Atlantis, is the largest fictional city Bethesda has developed.[7] As the player explores the game world, they encounter various non-playable characters (NPCs), some of whom may join the player's crew. Such NPCs may aid the player in combat, carry items, or during confrontations, speak to other NPCs on the player's behalf. Some may comment on choices the player makes.[8] The player may station crew members at any of their constructed outposts. Each companion character has their own unique skills and abilities. Some recruitable NPCs are able to be romanced by the player.[6]</p>
        <p>At the game's beginning, the player may customize their character, who is a silent protagonist. This includes choosing their body type, appearance, background, and traits. Choosing the background of the player character unlocks three starting skills.[6] As the player progresses, they will unlock additional traits which may aid or hinder them. For instance, the Introvert trait grants the player more endurance when travelling alone, but reduces their endurance when travelling with a companion. Traits are removable through quests or certain actions.[9] As the player progresses, they gain experience and level up, allowing them to unlock abilities found in five distinct skill trees: Physical, Social, Combat, Science, and Tech. Each skill can be ranked up by completing related challenges.[10] A variety of firearms, explosives, and melee weapons may be used to defeat enemies. Most weapons are customizable via attachments. Equipping a telescopic sight enhances a weapon's accuracy while equipping a suppressor may engender a stealth-oriented playing style.[11] The player is additionally able to equip various jetpacks (called boost packs), which aids the player in both combat and the traversal of impassable or challenging environments. When landed on a celestial body, the gravitational force acting upon the player varies depending upon the body's mass. This may affect combat.[12]</p>
