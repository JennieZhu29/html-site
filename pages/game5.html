        Baldur's Gate 3 is a role-playing video game with a single-player and
        cooperative multiplayer element. Players can create one or more
        characters and form a party along with a number of pre-generated
        characters to explore the game's story. Optionally, players are able to
        take one of their characters and team up online with other players to
        form a party.[2][3] Like previous games in the Baldur's Gate series,
        Baldur's Gate 3 has turn-based combat, similar to Larian's earlier games
        Divinity: Original Sin and Divinity: Original Sin II; all combat is
        based on the Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition rules.[4]

        The game is set in 1492 DR, over 120 years after the events of Baldur's
        Gate II: Shadows of Amn and months after the events of Baldur's Gate:
        Descent into Avernus. It features a branching plot where the main story
        elements stay mostly the same, regardless the players' choices, but with
        considerable variation in the details, especially concerning the
        numerous side quests. At the beginning of the game, players either
        create an original character who is essentially a "blank slate" in terms
        of back story, choose one of six pre-made "origin characters", or a
        customizable seventh "origin character". Each of the possible player
        characters have unique questlines to each other and certain paths, but
        largely play the same depending on play style.
